The scenario implements a very basic spoofer. However, for a realistic implementation, the attack must use gradual spoofing. We provided some references about real spoofing attacks.

The task consists of the following functions:

Implement a gradual spoofing attack, adapting the current Drone-Sim implementation (channel and spoofer) to make it more realistic than the current implementation
Generate some cases of the experiment (plots), which demonstrate the improvements
Write a (maximum) two-page report describing the changes, improvements, and achieved results. It also shows how it affects the cyber and physical domains.
Create a repository for the project in GitHub (the repository must be GNU General Public License v3.0)
Observation:

The new fork project could not change the idea of exercise design
You can include external libraries; however, a HOWTO file must be provided showing how to install them.
This activity must be performed in the same group in the Final Project.

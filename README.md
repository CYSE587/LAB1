Case 2 - Jamming

The scenario implements a very basic jammer, given the simplistic representation of the channel. However, for a realistic implementation, the attack must implement different types of jamming:

Continuous Wave (CW) Jamming
Sweeping Jamming (Frequency Hopping Jammer)
Pulsed Noise Jamming (Burst Jamming)
Directional Jamming (Beamforming Jamming)
We provided some references about real jamming attacks.

The task consists of the following functions:

Implement the different types of jamming attacks, adapting the current Drone-Sim implementation (channel and spoofer) to make it more realistic than the current implementation
Generate some cases of the experiment (plots), which demonstrate the improvements
Write a (maximum) two-page report describing the changes, improvements, and achieved results. It also shows how it affects the cyber and physical domains.
Create a repository for the project in GitHub (the repository must be GNU General Public License v3.0). It can be the same as case 1.
Observation:

The new fork project could not change the idea of exercise design
You can include external libraries; however, a HOWTO file must be provided showing how to install them.
This activity must be performed in the same group in the Final Project.
